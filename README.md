# 🔐 Security Labs Portfolio

This repository showcases my completed **PortSwigger Web Security Labs (2025)** as part of my **BSc (Hons) Computer Science** degree.  
It contains **write-ups, demo videos, and screenshots** that demonstrate my ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, and provide secure coding guidance.

## ✅ Completed Labs

### 1. Exploiting Path Mapping for Web Cache Deception
- **Focus**: Manipulating cache keys to serve sensitive data to unauthorized users.  
- **Demo Video**: [Watch here](https://mmutube.mmu.ac.uk/media/t/1_nd8roa2f)  

### 2. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in a Sandboxed Environment
- **Focus**: Exploiting template engines to execute unintended code.  
- **Demo Video**: [Watch here](https://mmutube.mmu.ac.uk/media/t/1_a9ekctci)  

### 3. Exploiting Server-Side Parameter Pollution
- **Focus**: Manipulating query strings to bypass logic and controls.  
- **Demo Video**: [Watch here](https://mmutube.mmu.ac.uk/media/t/1_m35oxaw0)  

### 4. Exploiting XSS to Bypass CSRF Defenses
- **Focus**: Using cross-site scripting payloads to bypass CSRF protections.  
- **Demo Video**: [Watch here](https://mmutube.mmu.ac.uk/media/t/1_3jtscam4)  

### 5. OS Command Injection (Simple Case)
- **Focus**: Injecting system commands via vulnerable input.  
- **Demo Video**: [Watch here](https://mmutube.mmu.ac.uk/media/t/1_2qm5dkaf)
